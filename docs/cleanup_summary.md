# Backtester App Cleanup Summary

## Completed Cleanup Tasks
Date: May 13, 2025

### Files Removed
1. `temp_wizard_start.py` - Temporary file with wizard implementation that was integrated into the main codebase
2. `src/ui/callbacks/wizard_callbacks.py.bak` - Backup file of wizard callbacks
3. `src/ui/callbacks/wizard_callbacks.py.clean.bak` - Another backup file of wizard callbacks
4. `src/ui/callbacks/wizard_callbacks.py.backup` - Yet another backup file of wizard callbacks
5. `src/ui/callbacks/fixed_callback.py` - Temporary fix file that has been integrated
6. `src/ui/callbacks/fixed_callback.py.bak` - Backup of temporary fix file

### Issues Fixed
1. Fixed indentation issues in `wizard_callbacks.py` to resolve syntax errors.
2. Removed duplicate callback targeting `STRATEGY_PARAM_INPUTS_CONTAINER` that was causing errors.
3. Fixed step labels in the stepper component to remove redundant words ("Risk" and "Trading").
4. Added a callback to enable the confirm button in Step 1 when a strategy is selected.

## Repository Structure Maintenance Roadmap

### 1. Code Organization
- **Callback Organization**: Keep callbacks in their appropriate files based on functionality:
  - `wizard_callbacks.py` for wizard-related callbacks
  - `strategy_callbacks.py` for strategy-related callbacks
  - `backtest_callbacks.py` for backtest-related callbacks
  - `risk_management_callbacks.py` for risk management related callbacks

- **Component Organization**: UI components should be kept in the `src/ui/components/` directory.

- **Layout Organization**: Layout-related code should be kept in the `src/ui/layouts/` directory.

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project:
  - Files: snake_case (e.g., `wizard_callbacks.py`)
  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `DataLoader`)
  - Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `register_callbacks`)
  - Variables: snake_case (e.g., `strategy_dropdown`)

### 3. Maintenance Best Practices
- **Version Control**: 
  - Use meaningful commit messages
  - Create feature branches for new features
  - Don't commit backup files (*.bak, etc.) to the repository

- **Code Hygiene**:
  - Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed
  - Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
  - Document complex code sections with comments

- **Testing**:
  - Add unit tests for new functionality
  - Test all changes before committing

### 4. Future Development Considerations
- Add type hints throughout the codebase for better IDE support and error detection
- Consider implementing a more robust state management system for the wizard
- Document the API and component interfaces for easier maintenance

### 5. Avoiding Redundancy
- Use centralized ID management through the `WizardIDs` class
- Import constants and reuse them rather than duplicating values
- Use helper functions for repeated code patterns

## Additional Cleanup Tasks (For Future)
1. Review and update docstrings for all functions
2. Consolidate any remaining duplicate code
3. Update documentation to reflect the current state of the application
