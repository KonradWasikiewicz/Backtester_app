# Backtester App - Product Design Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This document provides a complete specification for the Backtester App product. It includes descriptions of functionality, system architecture, user interface, and technical implementation aspects.

### 1.2 Product Scope
Backtester App is an application for testing investment strategies on historical financial data. It allows for definition, parameterization, and evaluation of trading strategies to assess their effectiveness before applying them in real markets.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Backtest** - process of testing a trading strategy on historical data
- **Strategy** - a set of rules defining market entry and exit conditions
- **Drawdown** - maximum decline in portfolio value from a peak
- **CAGR** - Compound Annual Growth Rate
- **SemVer** - Semantic Versioning, a product versioning system (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

## 2. General Product Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Backtester App is a standalone web application based on Dash/Python, offering comprehensive capabilities for testing trading strategies. The application can be developed into a full trading platform with broker integration.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Definition of investment strategy parameters
- Selection of financial instruments for testing
- Conducting backtests on historical data
- Visualization of results in charts and tables
- Analysis of performance indicators (CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, etc.)
- Risk management and scenario simulation

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The application is targeted at individual investors, traders, and financial analysts. Users should have basic knowledge of financial markets and investing.

### 2.4 Constraints
- The application operates in a local environment, without additional server configuration
- The quality of backtests depends on the availability and quality of historical data
- Strategy optimization may require significant computational resources

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Dash and Plotly for visualization
- Pandas for data analysis
- NumPy for mathematical calculations

## 5. Versioning and Change Control

### 5.1 Versioning System
The project uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format:
- **MAJOR**: backward-incompatible changes
- **MINOR**: new functionality, backward-compatible
- **PATCH**: bug fixes, backward-compatible

### 5.2 Version Update Process
1. Update version number in `src/version.py`
2. Update changelog with description of changes
3. Create a tag in the git repository

### 5.3 Reverting to Previous Versions
Process for reverting to a previous stable version:
1. Checkout the appropriate tag/branch from the git repository
2. Install required dependencies for that version
3. Run the application with the older code version

## 6. Product Development

### 6.1 Short-term Goals (6 months)
- Optimization of backtest performance
- Addition of new strategies
- Extended statistical analysis of results

### 6.2 Long-term Goals (12+ months)
- Frontend migration to React framework
- Integration with broker APIs
- Machine learning mechanisms for strategy optimization

### 6.3 Planned Technical Changes
